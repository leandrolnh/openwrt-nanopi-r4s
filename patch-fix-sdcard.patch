+Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: set initial signal voltage on power off
+
+Some boards have SD card connectors where the power rail cannot be switched
+off by the driver. If the card has not been power cycled, it may still be
+using 1.8V signaling after a warm re-boot. Bootroms expecting 3.3V signaling
+will fail to boot from a UHS card that continue to use 1.8V signaling.
+
+Set initial signal voltage in mmc_power_off() to allow re-boot to function.
+
+This fixes re-boot with UHS cards on Asus Tinker Board (Rockchip RK3288),
+same issue have been seen on some Rockchip RK3399 boards.
+
+I am sending this as a RFC because I have no insights into SD/MMC subsystem,
+this change fix a re-boot issue on my boards and does not break emmc/sdio.
+Is this an acceptable workaround? Any advice is appreciated.
