# openwrt-nanopi-r4s
Repository for a couple of patches that I use for building images for the NanoPi R4S, many of them were obtained form quintus-lab repo.

Apply the patches from the buildroot directory with ```patch -p1 < file.patch```.

The `diffconfig` file can be used as the base for the `.config` file.
